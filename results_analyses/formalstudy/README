Data item interpretation 
==========================================================

I. common columns
Pid		- participant id
Tid		- task id
Torder	- task sequence number
Res		- seeding resolution
Dcls	- data class
Did		- data id
Bname	- bundle name
Time	- task completion time (currently, from after data being loaded to "next" button click)
htime	- hesitation time (from the last chosen option highlight to "next" button click)
Correct - correctness, 1 - correct, 2 - wrong
Ans		- answer to a task
Key		- task key


II. task-specific columns

For heterogeneous columns "ec1 ec2 ec3 ec4 ec5" in dataSAS.txt only,
these columns indicate different set of data properties for different tasks.

For task 1
==============================
ec1 - FA difference between two boxes		
ec2 - average FA of voxels in box 1	
ec3 - number of fibers in box 1
ec4 - average FA of voxels in box 2
ec5 - number of fibers in box 2


For task 2
==============================
ec1 - number of fibers to be traced (i.e. number of the marked fibers)
ec2 - 0
ec3 - 0
ec4 - 0
ec5 - 0

For task 3
==============================
ec1 - number of fibers marked 
ec2 - 0
ec3 - 0
ec4 - 0
ec5 - 0

For task 4
==============================
ec1 - distance from user's click to the lesion center
ec2 - size of lesion area
ec3 - number of fibers in the lesion (i.e. number of the broken fibers)
ec4 - 0
ec5 - 0

For task 5
==============================
ec1 - number of fibers in member group
ec2 - number of fibers in alien group
ec3 - 0
ec4 - 0
ec5 - 0

For task 6
==============================
ec1 - size difference percentage between the two symmetrical bundles
