// situbeRender.h: load geometry in the format of "tgdata" and then wrap each
//					each streamline with rings resembling tubes. 
//
//					Note that the tubes produced are not of any anatomical
//					meanings but simply a geometrical artifacts. So they are not
//					genuine streamtubes
//
// Creation : Feb. 6th 2011
//
// Revision:
//	@Feb. 21th 
//		1.Geometry-based direction color encoding
//		2.add interaction option for using vertex coordinate as vertex normal 
//	@Feb. 24th
//		1. correct the problem of negative colors in the orientation color
//		encoding. By take fabs over the negative ones, this coloring becomes
//		a pure orientation color encoding scheme
//	@Feb. 26th
//		1. add a continuous and anatomically symmetric coloring encoding by
//			scaling the gamut of [-1,1] to [0,2] and then to [0,1]
//		2. add multiple coloring scheme support for coloring comparative
//		analysis
//	@Feb. 27th
//		1. extract coloring scheme stuff into an independent component as a
//			template class CColorMapper in colorscheme.h
//	@Feb. 28th
//		1. add an anatomical coordinate system, together with the spheric color
//		map gadget
//	@Mar. 2nd
//		1. add the DWI image embedding, held by one more gadget : CDcmExplorer
//		2. in order to ease implementation of mitubeRender, this single model
//		render, originally held in a single cpp, is mutated into an ordinary
//		class design and then instantiated in a boosting main-like cpp. Here
//		thus comes this header file
//	@Mar. 4th
//		1.add glutIdleFunc callback to support an IPC mechanism to receive user
//		interaction from other sinlge DTI model rendering process so that to
//		implement a synchronous interaction response, as is expressly serving
//		the MitubeRender
//	@Mar. 5th
//		1.add boolean flag to adapt the CSitubeRender class for building both a
//		single render and serving the CMitubeRender for building multiple-window
//		DTI model render - simply using m_nSiblings==0 as the boolean
//		2. add SIGUSR1 handler to receive the notification from parent that one
//		more sibling process died and thus to cut off the number of alive
//		siblings by 1, this is non-trivial since it will help CSitubeRender keep
//		aware of the latest number of siblings thus make possible the
//		interaction synchronization will still be correct even some of the
//		processes terminate on the way
//	@Mar. 6th
//		1.Fix the bug that when button is bounced up, the IPC mechanism does not
//		count when the event dispatching has finished, causing the event to be
//		kept being dispatched thus raising disorders, by forcing
//		glutPostRedisplay() even in the responser to button event while the
//		state being GLUT_UP, both in GLcppmoth and iselbox classes
//		2.When receiving SIGTERM, this process, mostly in the role of child
//		process, should grasp the last chance to release all resources,i.e to
//		invoke cleanup
//		3.Change special key response: END to terminate current process,
//		PAGE_DOWN to terminate all members of the process group
//		4.To enhance the flexibility in terms of being managed as
//		children/component, add a m_bSuspended switch to allow the manager to
//		postpone the entrance into GL event loop
//	@Mar. 9th
//		.add interaction help prompt gadget, a GL textbox; and an extra command
//		line argument for loading help text from a file; another key mapping is
//		also added accordingly as a switch of help text box presence:
//			F1 - switch help text box presence
//		.add task prompt gadget, a subtyped CGLTextbox; and an extra command
//		line argument for loading the task list file
//	@Mar. 10th
//		.for performing visualization tasks, going to the next task as the response
//		 to Space bar pressing is added
//		.Before each task is confirmed to start, nothing will be drawn on the
//		screen except the task box and all other inputs are blocked as well then
//		except for the Space bar
//	@Mar. 11th
//		.Two types of associative relation among all selection boxes are
//		defined: 
//			AND pattern - conditions must be met for all boxes (for selection
//			mode, a fiber is selected only if it goes through all boxes; for
//			removal mode, a fiber is removed only if it is outside of all
//			boxes);
//			OR pattern = conditions need be met for at least one boxes(for
//			selection mode, a fiber is selected if only one of the boxes covers
//			it; for removal mode, a fiber is culled if only one of the boxes
//			excludes it)
//		and another key shortcut is added accordingly
//			F2 - switching associative pattern among selection boxes
//		.Logic in isTubeInSelbox() is changed to be consistent with isLineInBox,
//		which is actually required to make sure that the selection/removal mode,
//		either in AND or OR pattern, works correctly geometrically.
//	@Mar. 12th
//		1.For the visualization study's purpose, saving/loading partial brain
//		model, one or certain other number of regions, say, is added as an
//		auxiliary functionality; this mainly impact CTgdataLoader::dump though,
//		and the change needed in CSitubeRender is the addition of new member
//		function dumpRegions(), as might be the response to key stroke or part
//		of process upon a task is done
//		--- the m_edgeflags member in parent class CGLIBoxApp is put into use
//		for this purpose, which is in fact meant for implementing vertex
//		selection that is not in use in CSitubeRender where we do not use vertex
//		flag to determine a streamline is in a box or not. So it is safe to make
//		this very reuse of the seemingly deprecated member here in CSitubeRender
// @Mar. 13th
//		1. For task0, change on the basis of study-specific version:
//			--- Keyboard and mouse mapping are all frosted except only
//			following:
//			Space : navigate,only forwards, through tasks
//			Mouse Left button: rotate around X/Y
//			Mouse left button + CTRL: rotate around Z
//
//			--- only use FA color, i.e. the original color offered in the tgdata
//			source
//
//			--- no selection box
//
//			--- show several point by circles and let user select the one of
//			highest FA value
//
//			--- 3D spherical color map changed to 2D rectangular color map
// @mar. 14th
//			-- exclusively for task 0: select two vertices of the model, draw
//			straight line with letter at the end as indicator; we want the user
//			to compare FAs of the two vertices
//			-- new member _getAnswer() is added to record what would be the
//			user's answer to the question raised in the task
// @Mar. 15th
//			--- exclusively for task 2 : load a fiber index file to check if the
//			marked region, a fiber bundle, includes fibers expected, i.e. fibers
//			that are listed by indices in the  loaded file
// @Mar. 16th
//			--- exclusively for task 3: marking a specific (indicated by the
//			loaded fiber indices) fiber bundle at the start points by attaching
//			equal-size spheres as markers
//			--- for task 3, since only moving is permitted for the box, mouse
//			left button will need have no effect on box therefore.
//			--- fix the box size as such that the end points of the expectedly
//			selected fibers can be safely covered.
// @Mar. 18th
//			--- change the color of spherical marker at the start point of
//			task-oriented expected fibers from white to yellow, which is more
//			perceptible for humans
